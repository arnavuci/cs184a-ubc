# How to run the notebook

Due to the size of the dataset and the requirement of hardware acceleration, we decided to code our project using Kaggle's notebook environment.
To run the code, please use the following instructions:

1. Visit the public notebook with the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/arnavamin/cs184a-ubc-final-project
2. Using the 3-dot menu on the right side of the top taskbar, select "Accelerator" and choose the "GPU P100" option.
3. On the top taskbar, click "Run All".
4. Please allow about 15 minutes for the code to run.

# Viewing the Pre-trained Model

Our code uses the EfficientNet-b0 model. However, there were complications in uploading the model to the GitHub repository. Therefore, to view or download the model we used for this project visit the link below:
https://www.kaggle.com/models/timm/tf-efficientnet/frameworks/PyTorch/variations/tf-efficientnet-b0/versions/1

The Kaggle Notebook also allows viewing of the dataset csv files. Nevertheless, we have provided the csv files in the GitHub repository as well.
